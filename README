This is my second coding puzzle. I did this live during an interview session
and failed miserably. However, after I left, I sat down at a local Starbucks
and erased my pathetic first attempt and started over. This is where I got.


				 Coding Puzzle
				 =============

(Note: the task was given in German language. This is my translation.)


Part I.)
Given following class:

    class Article
    {
    public:
        std::string name;
        int group;
        double price;
    };

Write a function which takes a list of articles. This function should then
return a new list which combines all articles within the same group.
Additionally, the prices of each article in that group should be represented as
sum and all article names should appear as comma-separated list whereas no
article name should be repeated in that list.

An exception to the rule above are articles within article group 0: These
articles should not combined. Ideally, the returned list is sorted by group.

Example input:

Name | Group | Price
_____________________
AA   | 1     | 100.00
BB   | 1     |  50.00
CC   | 2     |  75.00
AA   | 1     |  20.00
AA   | 0     | 100.00
BB   | 2     |  75.00
CC   | 2     |  80.00
AA   | 0     |  20.00

Output:

Name   | Group | Price
_______________________
AA     | 0     | 100.00
AA     | 0     |  20.00
AA, BB | 1     | 170.00
CC, BB | 2     | 230.00


Part II.)
Now, if all article groups can contain articles, how would you change your
program to allow also articles to contain other articles. Describe and discuss a
possible solution.

Limitations
- C++98 only
- you have about three hours time for your solution
- everything else is in your hands


				    Solution
				    ========

You can see my progress in the git log. I did not make it in time. I guess, I
got too nervous somewhere in between.

My final take on this was (after a hint of one of the interviewers) using a
std::map along with it's insert() function. Algorithmically, inserts are
O(N log N). However, more important, insert() returns a std:pair whose second
component denotes whether the element was actually inserted or not.
